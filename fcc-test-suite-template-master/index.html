      <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa<br>
        <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program
          known as the "National Youth Administration"</li><br>
        <li> 1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping
          starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
          climate on Earth.</li><br>
        <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields
        <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain
          that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's </li>wheat.</li><br>
        <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help
          mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population</li><br>
        <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
        <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li><br>
        <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
        <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops
          are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently
          dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
          it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>
        <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li>
        <br>
      </ul>
